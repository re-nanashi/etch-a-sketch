## Description

A simple beginner webpage that was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It runs renders dynamic elements according to user selection to be used as sketch or drawing canvas. Uses event listeners to inspect mouse functions to draw. This app has functions for clearing canvas, color select, eraser, canvas select, and side bar collapse. Since this a beginner project, it is made to be responsive only to few devices that uses medium to big size screens. No mobile support yet.
